# Bike-Sharing

## Overview

For this analysis, we used use Pandas to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype. Then, using the converted datatype, we created a set of visualizations to:

Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.
Finally, we added these new visualizations to the two you created in this module for your final presentation and analysis to pitch to investors. 

Deliverable 1: Change Trip Duration to a Datetime Format
Deliverable 2: Create Visualizations for the Trip Analysis
Deliverable 3: Create a Story and Report for the Final Presentation

## Results
This graph counts the overall number of bike rides by the Hour in New York City, for all users and all genders. The most common trip duration for a biker is 5 minutes, with a total of 147,683 rides. Majority of all bikers have a trip duration of 1 to 13 minutes.

The NYC Biker Ride data has been split by User Type (Customer and Subscriber) and the 3 colors represent the Gender - Female, Male, and Unknown. When looking User Type, the data suggests that most bike riders are subscribers. Many riders are of the Male gender. For subscribers of all genders, Thursdays tend to be the most popular day for bike rides.

Next, we examine the number of bike rides by gender, broken down by the hour and by the minute once again. The data can be filtered by gender and hour of day.

The data is visualized to show the Number of Bike Rides by Day and Time. The darker the area, the denser the data is, meaning the more bike rides during that time of day.
